# Tanks of Freedom 3-D Design Document

## Project Description

This document describes the details for a classic, turn-baset strategy game, that is a successor to *Tanks of Freedom*. It is meant to play very similarly to it's predecessor, while introducing 3D graphics, new story, new characters, and deepening the game mechanics it introduced.

Certain level of backwards compatibility is meant to be preserved. This new game should be able to import ToF online shared maps. It is not expected to be able to share maps, that original ToF could use. Online cross-play between ToF and this game is considered, but is not a part of core requirements.

Working title for the game is Tanks of Freedom 3-D, it is a subject to change, most likely based on it's story. Proposed title: *Tanks of Freedom - Liberum Gentem*


## World
A fictional world of Libre populated by humans. It consists of one, big landmass and an archipelago of islands of varying sizes. Team Yellow is situated in a place suitable for trade routes and with a lot of resources. It borders with Team Blue and Team Red. It also borders with Team Green, which is situated on the archipelago.

It is possible, there are other countries in this world, that are not part of the story, and could be used in the future.

### Sapphire Dawn (Team Blue)
A corporate, police state, that is secretly funding various warring factions of Team Yellow in order to weaken the region and take over their resources. In economic war with Team Red. Led by democratic oligarchy.

Style: Modern

### Ruby Dusk (Team Red)
Industrial nation, that is exploiting it's own population for cheap labour and suppresing freedom. Always looking for opportunities of new conquest. A rebel faction is organizing within, plotting to take over and end the regime.

Style: Steampunk

### Jade Twilight (Team Green)
A peacful and prosperous nation, consisting of a federation of Islands. An uneasy ally to Team Blue, but also in trade relations with Team Red. Offering aid to Team Yellow on the condition of maintainig internal Peace, but not willing to interfere. Led by democratic government.

Style: Futuristic

### Golden Noon (Team Yellow)
A feudal nation splintered into warring factions. Internal struggle is secretly fueled by Team Blue. Country is led by royal family, with a weak king and a prince hoping to unite his people and end the civil war.

Style: Feudal/Knights

- The General
- The Commando

### Ruby Dusk (Team Red)
- The Bright Leader
- The Inquisitor

### Jade Twilight (Team Green)

## Story

Team Yellow factions, fighting a civil war, go beyond their borders and start attacking their neighbours as well. Provoked, Team Red starts an invasion on Team Yellow land. Team blue offers help, also asking their ally, Team Green, to join the fight against Team Red.

### Theme

The game is about deception, political agendas and freedom. None of the factions are purely good or bad. Story has to decieve the player into thinking, that certain factions and characters are definately bad, and then subvert their expectations. Some light-hearthed banter between characters and cartoony approach should be used.


## Story Progression

Team Yellow military is constantly fighting local insurgents and warlords, their country splintered into factions. Some are loyal to the royal family, some willing to create their own kingdoms.

#### Prologue
Team Red is attacked by a group of terrorists from Team Yellow. They interpret this as an act of war, and use this opportunity to gain more land. An offensive begins.

#### Red Campaign
Team Red captures several provinces of Team Yellow, preparing for total annexation. As they gain significant presence, commander is being recalled to the country in order to quell an uprising. Rebels willing to align themselves with Team Green try to remove the Regime, and the capital city needs to be defended.

#### Blue Campaign
Team Blue, afraid of Team Red gaining too much power and resources by absorbing Team Yellow, offers help. Royal family accepts, and in a series of battles between Red and Blue, Team Red offensive is stopped. Not having enough forces, Team Blue asks their allies, Team Green, for help in pushing Team Red back into their territory. After a joint battle, Team Red retreats.

#### Green Campaign
After investigating terrorist camps, Team Green discovers they were backed by Team Blue in order to destabilise Team Yellow and take their lands. Green, realising they will need allies, decides to aid the Red Rebels. In the meantime Team Blue starts an offensive on weakened Team Yellow, taking advantage of large amount of Blue forces deployed all over Yellow country. Green and newly reformed Red start a counter-offensive aimed at freeing Yellow. They reach royal palace and reinstate royal family.

#### Yellow Campaign
Yellow Prince has to re-take his country from Team Blue and Blue-backed Yellow warlords. Some Yellow factions support him from the beggining, other need to be brought back into the fold. Once this is done, Team Yellow, together with Team Green and Team Red attack Team Blue, who plan on deploying WMDs in order to force victory.

## Gameplay

Lorem ipsum

### Goals

Overall goal of the game is to get through all of the campaign missions, and witness the story of the four warring nations.

In a single mission, goals are determined by the story. A win might be considered by reaching one of the many possible objectives (alternative paths) or require multiple to be achieved within single mission.
A list of possible win conditions:
- Capturing enemy HQ
- Surviving set amount of turns
- Capturing designated building(s)
- Destroying designated unit(s)
- Reaching designated area with (optionally specific) units
- Building up set amount of resources

### User Skills

- Click and drag with a mouse
- Use WSAD keyboard
- (OR) Use XBox-style gamepad
- Manage resources
- Strategize according to objectives
- Make tactical combat decisions
- Assess usefulness of different units
- Assess value of buildings
- Read on-screen messages

### Game Mechanics

This game is a turn-based strategy, where one player commands his/her forces fully, and the turn ends when all posible actions are exhausted, or player decides to pass the turn. Up to 4 players can play in a single match.

Game is played on a board consisting of square tiles, populated with terrain, units, buildings and obstacles. Player is awarded a resource at the beggining of the turn, which can be spent on new units or active skills.
Each unit can be moved, attack enemy units, activate special abilities or defend a position. All actions need to be contextual and easy to execute with two buttons. Unit actions are limited by the amount of it's own action points and other attributes.
Buildings can be neutral, or belong to one of the players. Player can ocuppy a building, that does not belong to them in order to capture it. Buildings can fulfill one or more of roles: provide resources, enable deployment of new units, repair units, or be a strategic objective.

There will be no Fog of War, that was present in the previous game.
There will be no dedicated battle screen, with combat taking place direclty on the main board.

Combat may cause collateral damage to the buildings and terrain around them.
Infantry can move onto a building tile to gain bonuses. Bonuses decrease with building damage.
Certain terrain tiles can provide bonuses or penalties.

Resources gained from buildings will be taxed according to the amount of units deployed, to prevent unit spam.

### Progression and challange

Campaign will offer progression in form of gradual unlocking of new buildings and abilities. This will also be true for the AI opponents, to match the challange. In custom games, map creator will be able to decide which units, buildings and abilities are available.
Story progresses by in-game dialog, in-game on-board cutscenes.

In a match, progression will be possible by capturing more buildings, gathering more resources and recruiting more units.
Units will be able to gain XP and level up, which will result in them gaining minor stat boosts and unlocking abilities.

Difficulty can be adjusted by the player by choosing one of three possible difficulty levels. These will affect how many resources AI has. Difficulty can be selected on per-AI basis.
In PvP matches, there is no difficulty setting.

### Losing

There is no way of loosing a campaign, as each of the missions can be re-played as many times as player wishes (or needs).
A loss might be considered by failing to fullfill one of the many possible objectives (alternative paths) or require multiple to fail within single mission.
A list of possible loss conditions:
- Loosing player HQ
- Failing to complete objectives within set amount of turns
- Loosing designated building(s)
- Loosing designated unit(s)
- Enemy reaching designated area with (optionally specific) units
